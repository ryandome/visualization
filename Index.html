What makes a visualization effective?

An effective visualization I found comes from the United States Patent and Trademark Office or USPTO. Their visualiaton is called PatentsView, and it contains multiple interactive sections that allow you to see the relationships between patents and inventors, and compare the number of patents being filed across different years, countries and US states. The section I would focus my attention on is the one titled Locations. This is a map showing the top 200 cities around the world with the most U.S. patents granted since 2013. This visualization has the five qualites Cairo says are necessary for a good visualization. It is truthful, this is based directly off of records of U.S. patents granted by the government. It is functional. When zoomed out the map shows that a vast majority of the pantents come from America, Europe, and East Asia while no city is South America or Africa makes the top 200. Zoom and you can see which countries are represented, zoom in even further and you see the individual cities this provides multiple levels at which you can view and interpret the data. It is beatiful in that it keeps things simple and doesn't try to be too artistic or stylized. It's insightful and enlightening because it provides data on what places around the world are innovative and it is important to see how foreign entities and inventors also want to have their inventions recognized and protected in the United States. This visual and the knowledge it provides sparks wonder and curiosity because it makes you think about what led to these 200 locations being centers of innovation; and does having more patents really make a city more innovation?

  While it is effective is some areas the USA Today infographic Copy,paste,legislate is overall a poor visualization due to flaws in its presentation. The purpose of this infographic is to show laws being proposed by legislators who are not the main authors of the bill. Rather these bills are primarily written by companies and lobbying groups. In terms of truthfulness I have no reason to suspect that honest research was not done as proposed legislation is recorded and could be obtained by the researchers. I do have concerns with how the data is depicted. The visual does not tell you how much writing must be the same between two bills for them to say one is based off the other. It also groups the bills into catgories whether they supported Indsustry, Conservatives, Liberals, and Other. The visual fails to explain what separates these categories. Their decision to represent the data as taking up a portion of a circle is not very functional and it is far easier to to just look at the numbers listed. It is not beautiful. Due to its design at times there will be text boxes blocking your views of the data and charts. Some of the text in these text boxes is also stylized to look like it is being selected on a computer in order to copy and paste it. This makes sense given the topic of the visual but overall I find it be distracting and unnecessary for drawing your attention since many of the text boxes are already small to begin with. This visual does present an interesting topic but it is held back by stylistic choices and the decisions on how to depict its data. With some changes it could be a much more effective visual.
